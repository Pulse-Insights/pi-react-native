This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Prerequisites

### Java 17 Requirement

This project requires **Java 17** for Android builds. You have several options to configure this:

#### Option 1: Set JAVA_HOME environment variable (Recommended)
```bash
# For macOS with Homebrew
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openjdk@17/17.0.11/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home

# For macOS with Oracle JDK
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-17.jdk/Contents/Home

# Add to your shell profile (~/.zshrc, ~/.bash_profile, etc.) to make it permanent
echo 'export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/java17' >> ~/.zshrc
```

#### Option 2: Use jenv (if you have multiple Java versions)
```bash
# Install Java 17 if not already installed
brew install openjdk@17

# Set Java 17 for this project only
jenv local 17
```

#### Option 3: Project-specific configuration
Uncomment and modify the line in `android/gradle.properties`:
```properties
org.gradle.java.home=/path/to/your/java17
```
> **Warning**: This approach is not recommended for team projects as paths vary between developers.

### Verify Java 17 Installation
```bash
# Check available Java versions
/usr/libexec/java_home -V

# Verify current Java version
java -version
```

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
